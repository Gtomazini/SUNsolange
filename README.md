# About:
It is a visual novel adventure game about collecting data from our environment, based on the GLOBE Protocol, and aims to teach about the project
that has existed since the 90s, combining a fun theory with a practical simulation of some scenarios. Aunt Solange is your guide in this world and, despite being clumsy, she will do whatever she can to teach you about how the GLOBE Protocol can help us and what we can improve.
