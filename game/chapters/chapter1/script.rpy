    sol "{fast}For a precise analysis of aquatic pH, we used a glass electrode combined with a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, calibrated with phosphate and phthalate buffer solutions. Potentiometric measurement is based on the Nernst equation, taking into account the activity of hydronium ions in solution. It is crucial to take into account ionic strength, temperature and liquid junction effects. We use potentiometric titration techniques to determine alkalinity and acidity, using indicators such as phenolphthalein and methyl orange. Data interpretation requires chemical speciation analysis, considering complex acid-base balances in natural aquatic systems, including the carbonate system and the presence of humic and fulvic acids which can significantly affect the pH and buffering capacity of water"

    sol "How about we start our scientific adventure right now?"
    sol "But first I'll teach you a little about water measurements"
    #PICTURE OF PHMETER
    sol "Did you know that water can be acidic, neutral or alkaline? And to find out, we use a very cool device called a pH meter!"
    sol "Imagine you have a pH meter in your hands. It looks like a ruler with a needle that moves.
When you dip the tip of this device into the water, the needle shows you a number that helps you understand whether the water is good to drink or whether there's something wrong with it."
    sol "First, we need to make sure that the pH meter is clean. That way, it can measure properly! Then we take a glass of the water we want to test, either tap water or water from a lake."
    sol "Then we dip the tip of the pH meter into the water and count to three. Look how magical it is: the needle starts to move and, after a little while, stops at a number on the scale.
This number tells us whether the water is acidic, neutral or alkaline!"
    sol "If the needle stops at a number less than 7, it means that the water is acidic, like lemon. If it stops at exactly 7, the water is neutral,
like the water we drink. And if the number is greater than 7, the water is alkaline, like bicarbonate."
    sol "Now to the challenge"
